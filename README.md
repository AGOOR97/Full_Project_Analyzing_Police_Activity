## Analyzing Police Activity .... By / Mohammed AGooR

### brief Notes :
Apply knowledge by answering interesting questions about a real dataset!, 
explore the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset and analyze the impact of gender on police behavior, 
gain more practice cleaning messy data, creating visualizations, 
combining and reshaping datasets, and manipulating time series data. 

### Steps of Analysis:

#### 1- Preparing the data for analysis
Before beginning my analysis, it is critical that I first examine and clean the dataset, to make working with it a more efficient process. 
I will practice fixing data types, handling missing values, and dropping columns and rows while learning about the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset.

#### 2- Exploring the relationship between gender and policing
Does the gender of a driver have an impact on police behavior during a traffic stop? 
To explore that question while practicing filtering, grouping, method chaining, Boolean math, string methods, and more!

#### 3- Visual exploratory data analysis
Are you more likely to get arrested at a certain time of day? Are drug-related stops on the rise? 
To answer these and other questions by analyzing the dataset visually, since plots can help us to understand trends in a way that examining the raw data cannot.

#### 4- Analyzing the effect of weather on policing
Using a second dataset to explore the impact of weather conditions on police behavior during traffic stops. 
Merging and reshaping datasets, assessing whether a data source is trustworthy, working with categorical data, and more...
